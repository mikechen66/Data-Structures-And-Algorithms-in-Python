# C-6.15
# Suppose Alice has picked three distinct integers and placed them into a
# stack S in random order. Write a short, straight-line piece of pseudo-code
# (with no loops or recursion) that uses only one comparison and only one
# variable x, yet that results in variable x storing the largest of Aliceâ€™s three
# integers with probability 2/3. Argue why your method is correct.


# x = max(S.pop(), S.pop()

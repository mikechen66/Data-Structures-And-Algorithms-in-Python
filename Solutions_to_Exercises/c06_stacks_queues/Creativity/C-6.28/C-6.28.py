# C-6.28
# Modify the ArrayQueue implementation so that the queueâ€™s capacity is
# limited to maxlen elements, where maxlen is an optional parameter to the
# constructor (that defaults to None). If enqueue is called when the queue
# is at full capacity, throw a Full exception (defined similarly to Empty).

# modified enqueue method and added self._maxlen attribute

# R-4.8
# Isabel has an interesting way of summing up the values in a sequence A of
# n integers, where n is a power of two. She creates a new sequence B of half
# the size of A and sets B[i] = A[2i]+A[2i+1], for i = 0,1, . . . , (n/2)âˆ’1. If
# B has size 1, then she outputs B[0]. Otherwise, she replaces A with B, and
# repeats the process. What is the running time of her algorithm?#

At worst, the algorithm is O(n)

Let S a sequence of length n = 2^(x), where x is an integer
Isabel's algorithms will copy elements of the list m times
-> m = n/2^(1) + n/2^(2) + n/2^(3) + ... + n/2^(x) 
     = 2^(x)/2^(1) + 2^(x)/2^(2) + 2^(x)/2^(3) + ... + 2^(x)/2^(x)

# C-5.30
# When Bob wants to send Alice a message M on the Internet, he breaks M
# into n data packets, numbers the packets consecutively, and injects them
# into the network. When the packets arrive at Aliceâ€™s computer, they may
# be out of order, so Alice must assemble the sequence of n packets in order
# before she can be sure she has the entire message. Describe an efficient
# scheme for Alice to do this, assuming that she knows the value of n. What
# is the running time of this algorithm?

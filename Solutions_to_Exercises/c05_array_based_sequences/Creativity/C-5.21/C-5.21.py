# C-5.21
# In Section 5.4.2, we described four different ways to compose a long
# string: (1) repeated concatenation, (2) appending to a temporary list and
# then joining, (3) using list comprehension with join, and (4) using generator
# comprehension with join. Develop an experiment to test the efficiency
# of all four of these approaches and report your findings.

# Execution takes about a minute.
# You can remove the print() in the first loop to clear the console
# Keep it to show progression
#
# Every function exhibit linear behavior, but they do not share the same constant factor
# function #3 (list comprehension) seems to be the best one,
# even though the author says the best one should be #4 (generator comprehension)

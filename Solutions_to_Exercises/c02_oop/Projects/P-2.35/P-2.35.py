# P-2.35
# Write a set of Python classes that can simulate an Internet application in
# which one party, Alice, is periodically creating a set of packets that she
# wants to send to Bob. An Internet process is continually checking if Alice
# has any packets to send, and if so, it delivers them to Bobâ€™s computer, and
# Bob is periodically checking if his computer has a packet from Alice, and,
# if so, he reads and deletes it.

# C-5.14
# The shuffle method, supported by the random module, takes a Python
# list and rearranges it so that every possible ordering is equally likely.
# Implement your own version of such a function. You may rely on the
# randrange(n) function of the random module, which returns a random
# number between 0 and n−1 inclusive.

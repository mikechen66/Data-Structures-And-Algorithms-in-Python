# C-3.42
# Bob built a Web site and gave the URL only to his n friends, which he
# numbered from 1 to n. He told friend number i that he/she can visit the
# Web site at most i times. Now Bob has a counter, C, keeping track of the
# total number of visits to the site (but not the identities of who visits). What
# is the minimum value for C such that Bob can know that one of his friends
# has visited his/her maximum allowed number of times?

print("""If every friend can visit i-1 times the website before Bob can know
         Therefore, the number is n(n+1)/2 - n = (n^2)/2 + 1.""")

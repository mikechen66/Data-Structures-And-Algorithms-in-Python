# R-3.31
# Given an n-element sequence S of integers, Algorithm C executes an
# O(n)-time computation for each even number in S, and an O(logn)-time
# computation for each odd number in S. What are the best-case and worstcase
# running times of Algorithm C?

print("Best case: O(log(n))")
print("Worst case: O(n)")

# R-3.34
# There is a well-known city (which will go nameless here) whose inhabitants
# have the reputation of enjoying a meal only if that meal is the best
# they have ever experienced in their life. Otherwise, they hate it. Assuming
# meal quality is distributed uniformly across a personâ€™s life, describe
# the expected number of times inhabitants of this city are happy with their
# meals?

# Let n be the number of days lived
# People in this city eat only one meal a day
# Therefore, the probability of enjoying a meal is 1/n everyday
#
# The average cumulative number of times an inhabitant enjoyed a meal is the sum of 1/i,
# where i goes from 1 to n

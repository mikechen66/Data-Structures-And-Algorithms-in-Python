# P-7.47
# Implement a CardHand class that supports a person arranging a group of
# cards in his or her hand. The simulator should represent the sequence of
# cards using a single positional list ADT so that cards of the same suit are
# kept together. Implement this strategy by means of four “fingers” into the
# hand, one for each of the suits of hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds,
# so that adding a new card to the person’s hand or playing a correct card
# from the hand can be done in constant time. The class should support the
# following methods:
#   • add card(r, s): Add a new card with rank r and suit s to the hand.
#   • play(s): Remove and return a card of suit s from the player’s hand;
#     if there is no card of suit s, then remove and return an arbitrary card
#     from the hand.
#   • iter (): Iterate through all cards currently in the hand.
#   • all of suit(s): Iterate through all cards of suit s that are currently in
#     the hand.

# P-7.44
# Write a simple text editor that stores and displays a string of characters
# using the positional list ADT, together with a cursor object that highlights
# a position in this string. A simple interface is to print the string and then
# to use a second line of output to underline the position of the cursor. Your
# editor should support the following operations:
# • left: Move cursor left one character (do nothing if at beginning).
# • right: Move cursor right one character (do nothing if at end).
# • insert c: Insert the character c just after the cursor.
# • delete: Delete the character just after the cursor (do nothing at end).

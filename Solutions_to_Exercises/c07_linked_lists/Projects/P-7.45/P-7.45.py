# An array A is sparse if most of its entries are empty (i.e., None). A list
# L can be used to implement such an array efficiently. In particular, for
# each nonempty cell A[i], we can store an entry (i,e) in L, where e is the
# element stored at A[i]. This approach allows us to represent A using O(m)
# storage, where m is the number of nonempty entries in A. Provide such
# a SparseArray class that minimally supports methods getitem (j) and
# setitem (j, e) to provide standard indexing operations. Analyze the
# efficiency of these methods.

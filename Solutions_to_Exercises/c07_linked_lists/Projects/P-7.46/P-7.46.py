# P-7.46
# Although we have used a doubly linked list to implement the positional
# list ADT, it is possible to support the ADT with an array-based implementation.
# The key is to use the composition pattern and store a sequence
# of position items, where each item stores an element as well as that element’s
# current index in the array. Whenever an element’s place in the array
# is changed, the recorded index in the position must be updated to match.
# Given a complete class providing such an array-based implementation of
# the positional list ADT. What is the efficiency of the various operations?

# C-7.42
# Describe a method for performing a card shuffle of a list of 2n elements,
# by converting it into two lists. A card shuffle is a permutation where a list
# L is cut into two lists, L1 and L2, where L1 is the first half of L and L2 is the
# second half of L, and then these two lists are merged into one by taking
# the first element in L1, then the first element in L2, followed by the second
# element in L1, the second element in L2, and so on.

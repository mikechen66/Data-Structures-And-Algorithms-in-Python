# C-7.37
# Implement a function that accepts a PositionalList L of n integers sorted
# in nondecreasing order, and another value V, and determines in O(n) time
# if there are two elements of L that sum precisely toV. The function should
# return a pair of positions of such elements, if found, or None otherwise.

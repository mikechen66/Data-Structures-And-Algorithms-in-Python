# C-7.38
# There is a simple, but inefficient, algorithm, called bubble-sort, for sorting
# a list L of n comparable elements. This algorithm scans the list nâˆ’1 times,
# where, in each scan, the algorithm compares the current element with the
# next one and swaps them if they are out of order. Implement a bubble sort
# function that takes a positional list L as a parameter. What is the running
# time of this algorithm, assuming the positional list is implemented with a
# doubly linked list?
